Microscope
==========

A game made for the game competition Ludum Dare #31 in 2014.

The game is written in JavaScript and runs with three.js to run faster and utilizes the shader post processing capabilities. Images and music is done by me, other used sources can be seen [here](http://www.nada.kth.se/~johntu/microscopic).

# How to run
The game is run with the `index.html` file in a web browser. Because of the loading of assets to the game it cannot be run locally but must instead be run on a server. My favourite method is to run a `SimpleHTTPServer` with python in the root folder from a terminal.
